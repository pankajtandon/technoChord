FP:
  immutability and higher order functions are not the main draw
  Function pipeline/chaining and lazy evaluaton is
  
  - Observable different from Observer pattern is that an end-of-signal is sent by Observables
  - Errors are not thrown 'back' as in Imperative programming but is treated like a first class citizen and is processed as data
  - Sync and Async can be implemented on either server or client

I like this ascii art:
